          The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with 
          each other. Creating a Webpage requires a detailed understanding of HTML and CSS. I want to understand how to create a Webpage because I am learning about Webpages and want to become proficient in creating a webpage like this one  https://www.att.com/ with pictures and videos. 
          <span class="italic"> Where my webpage brings you to another webpage. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends 
          it back to the user's computer where a <span class="italic">
          web browser</span> interprets the page and displays it on 
          the user's screen to display an image </p>
          <a href= "<a href="http://imgur.com/soBMOL9"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/soBMOL9.png?1" title="source: imgur.com" /></a> </a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>"

       <body> Teaches you new skills and new words like <span class="italic">Hypertext Markup 
          Language.</span> HTML documents form the majority of the 
          content on the web.
          It looks like this <a href="http://imgur.com/yg91x2l"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yg91x2l.jpg?1" title="source: imgur.com" /><p>

                You have to use a series of instructions to tell the computer what you want to do- for example indent, new paragraph, information on each line, etc. </p> </body>

          Uploading pictures is not as easy as you would think. I found this Imgur website to upload my pictures, and it is easy to import those pictures into this Webpage. Videos are new to me, but, I am going to add a video here to show that I have found a way of doing it</p>
